# Memory Access & Data Movement

1. Ensure sequential memory access patterns
Traverse memory linearly whenever possible. Seuquential access maximizes cache line utilization and hardware prefetch efficiency.

2. Prefer pointer iteration over indexed access in tight loops - ensure sequential memory access patterns
Sequential pointer traversal reduces address recomputation and improves auto-vectorization.

3. Prefetch data when accessing through indices
If you access arrays indirectly through an index list, the CPU cannot predict what memory will be needed next. Manually prefetching upcoming elements helps hide memory latency and reduces cache misses.

4. Copy small records into local variables
When repeatedly accessing multiple fields of a small struct, copy the struct into a local variable first. This allows the compiler to keep values in registers instead of reloading them from memory.

5. Avoid unnecessary move or copy operations
Use in-place construction and rely on compiler elision where possible.

# Loop Structure & Invariants

6. Hoist invariant work out of loops
Any computation, lookup, or reference that does not change per iteration must be moved outside the loop.

7. Eliminate repeated structural checks
Do not repeatedly verify conditions that are constant or guaranteed.
Compute once, cache once, or rely on established invariants.
Also, if different conditions require different processing strategies, determine the strategy before the loop starts and then run the appropriate version. Avoid checking the same conditions repeatedly while scanning data.

8. Decide execution strategy before entering the loop
If multiple processing modes exist, select the mode once and run a dedicated loop variant.

9. Avoid duplicating large loop bodies
If several branches run almost identical loops with only small differences in filtering, combine them into one loop and control behavior with flags. This keeps code smaller, improves instruction cache usage, and helps the compiler optimize better.

# Control Flow

10. Minimize branching in inner loops
Use early-continue filtering or direct predicate-based accumulation.
Avoid auxiliary state flags if results can be inferred.

11. Consider branchless computation when branch prediction is poor
If control flow is unpredictable, replace branches with arithmetic masking.
Computing a boolean condition and using it to control arithmetic (e.g., multiply by 0 or 1) can be faster than branching, especially in large scans.

# Arithmetic & Computation Cost

12. Remove expensive arithmetic from hot loops
Avoid division or other high-latency operations per element.
Precompute constants or perform normalization after aggregation.

13. Avoid expensive general-purpose parsing in hot paths
Do not use high-level string conversions or substring allocation inside tight loops (e.g. std::stoi, std::stod, substr).
Prefer fixed-format, allocation-free parsing directly from raw memory.

# Containers & Lookup Struktures

14. Pre-size output containers using realistic estimates
Estimate result size from selectivity or statistics to avoid dynamic growth.

15. Replace repeated linear searches with indexed lookup structures
Use hash-based or constant-time lookup instead of scanning collections repeatedly.

# Algorithm Selection

16. Use algorithms specialized for data characteristics
For fixed-width numeric keys or sortable primitives, prefer non-comparison-based or domain-specific algorithms.

# Compiler Optimization Signals

17. Communicate aliasing guarantees
Tell the compiler when memory regions do not overlap (e.g. restrict semantics).

18. Inline hot functions when beneficial
Reduces call overhead and exposes optimization opportunities.

# Vectorizaton & Hardware Utilization

19. Exploit SIMD parallelism where applicable
Process multiple elements per iteration using vectorized comparisons and masked arithmetic.
